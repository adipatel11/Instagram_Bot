# Background Information

Upon reading on the instaloader documentation, I found a wide variety of information that I could collect from certain Instagram profiles such as 
user followers and followees. I have used this to create the non-follower program. This takes both of these items and determines the profiles that
a user follows that does not follow them back. The account that will be searching will need to "log in" using the .login method, and the account that
will be searched for will need to have its username stored in the variable "searchee".

## I will continue to create programs that make use of such information and serve some sort of automation purpose.
